# BotsTalk

This a simple yet interesting program that makes two online AI chatbots(from cleverbot.com) talk to each other. 
The program just takes data from one bot and feeds to another and vice versa automatically. It starts with feeding an initial message 
"Hello bot" to the first bot.
Then the data is just transferred back and forth.
The program needs Selenium ChromeDriver to work.
The program is simple but it's a pretty good demonstration of both, the power of web crawling and also the ability of artificially intelligent machines to communicate.
Thank you.
